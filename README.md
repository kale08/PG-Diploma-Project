This project is my first independent project in data and analytics

## Problem Statement:

The investment firm specializing in portfolio management needs to provide tailored investment consultation to two distinct clients, Mr. Patrick Jyenger and Mr. Peter Jyenger. The objective is to develop investment strategies aligned with each client's financial objectives and risk tolerance. The challenges include:

_**Client 1 (Mr. Patrick Jyenger):**_
a. Designing a portfolio that maintains a decent standard of living for Mr. Patrick post-retirement.
b. Developing investment strategies that align with Mr. Patrick's conservative investment approach.
c. Allocating $500,000 to invest in a minority stake in the magazine Naruto and the remaining $500,000 in equities.
d. Aim to double the capital within 5 years with minimized risk to acquire a minority portion of Naruto.

_**Client 2 (Mr. Peter Jyenger):**_
a. Creating a portfolio that caters to Mr. Peter's preference for high-return investments.
b. Assessing and managing the risks associated with high-return investments as per Mr. Peter's risk tolerance.
c. Investing $1 million from the company's cash and cash equivalents in high-margin stocks.
d. Striving for high returns within 5 years to facilitate the inorganic expansion of JWW.

The challenge lies in leveraging available resources, conducting thorough market analysis, and formulating investment strategies that meet the distinct financial goals and risk appetites of both clients. The portfolio manager must deliver optimal solutions while considering the competition from other portfolio managers and rival firms operating in the same industry.
